## Assignment Overview:
This Tasks aima to mimic how a terminal or a commandline works, and practicing multi-process programs. In this task we learned about `fork()`
, `wait()` to make a new process and how to handle it.

There are two scripts I worte: `lol.sh` is used to comple and run the program -the `main.c` file only-, if no errors were found.
and `lol_cpp.sh` which is used to do the same as `lol.sh` but for `main.cpp` file

in order to run one of the script, first yu have to make sure the script is executable, or just make it executable. This is only done once
```bash
chmod +x lol.cpp
chmod +x lol_cpp.sh
```

In order to run the script, you will write the following line to compile and run the c file
```bash
./lol.sh
```
or the following line for the cpp file.
```bash
./lol_cpp.sh
```
